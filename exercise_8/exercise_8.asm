Reset:
	ldy #10             ; Initialize the Y register with the decimal value 10

Loop:
	tya                 ; Transfer Y to A
	sta $80,Y           ; Store the value in A inside memory position $80+Y
    dey                 ; Decrement Y
	bpl Loop            ; Branch back to "Loop" until we are done
	; bne Loop          ; First solution: I used bne before and store the value 0 inside memory position $80.

	; NOTES(Ruan): I'm not sure if there is a better way to do this,
	; since I can't overflow the value to reach 0 again. This way, it only takes a 
	; single instruction before storing the value #0 in the memory position.
	; Any other way of changing the value in register A would take at least 2 instructions
	; (like "sec, sbc #1", for example). I researched ways of doing it with other instructions,
	; but for that to happen, we would have to always use the A register (like using BVS or BVC), 
	; which would take more instructions and, therefore, more cycles.
	
	; Notes(Ruan, a few days later): Looking at the solution, the "bpl" instruction
	; does exactly what I was looking for. I just didn't know it did was it does :)
